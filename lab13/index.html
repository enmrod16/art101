					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to "experiment with loops."</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first my JavaScript wasn't working and due to issues with the table, then I had problems with seeing my Output on my html. I thought it wasn't showing up at all but my console showed no errors, and I realized after highlighting my page that the text was there. I just had to do some fixes on CSS.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Look below at the table!</p>
