					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to debug our old assignments/labs.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a difficult time finding anything to debug in my labs since nothing appeared in the console to show that there was something wrong. The only lab that had an issue that popped up in the console was lab 7, so that was the lab i went and fixed. It wasn't really a coding issue, but more so a issue with my files in VS Code CSS wise.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My labs are running bug free and appear as they should..</p>
