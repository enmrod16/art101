			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>Hi. This is Steve Lin and Saint Rodriguez. We are from two different sections, but have 
				decided to work together for this lab and those to come. Our levels of programming experience differ 
				greatly but we are still enjoying our labs so far regardless. We are both AGPM majors and have big plans for 
				our futures too but for now we're just college students.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was figuring out HTML, CSS, and why our art101 project files looked different.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problems we had were following directions on our canvas assignment as my (Saint) project files did not match
						the screenshots on canvas.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Initially, there was some panic due to the issues we had but once we figured out how to fix it everything went smoothly.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
