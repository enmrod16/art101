			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to pseudocode an everyday task, and then pseudcode a simple computer game.
						The goal was to start thinking of pseudocoding before actually getting into the real coding of an item.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we only had problems when we were attempting to pseudocode a game. We had a lot of ideas, but settled on
						pseudocoding the classic snake game. We had to figure out how to explain the loss condition and the scoring of points
					 but through some back and forth we got to a satisfactory explanation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Lists:
					</p> 
					<ol>Cooking an egg
						<li>Gather your materials; Pan, egg, oil, spatula, etc. </li>
						<li>Set the pan on the stove and allow it to heat up.</li>
						<li>Pour a light amount of oil into it.</li>
						<li>Crack the egg straight into the pan.</li>
						<li> Allow the egg white to set, then scramble or cook it until it’s to your liking. (Be careful not to overcook it.)</li></ol>

					<ol> Snake game
						<li>Print player map.</li>
						<li>Accept/Validate player movement.</li>
						<li>Spawn new items/sprites.</li>
						<li>Elongate player avatar. </li>
						<li>Continue spawning new items/sprites until the player hits the wall, themselves, or they cannot continue.</li>
						<li>Test win/loss condition.</li></ol>
					</p>

			SNAKE GAME JS EDITION
				// Sprites.
						// Set up the player sprite in idle mode.
						// Set up the AI sprite in idle mode.
				// Print player map.
						 // Lay out barriers such as walls.
				// Print player UI.
						// Lay out scores in the top left corner.
				// Accept/Validate player movement.
						 // Accept player movements of moving left, right, up, and down when keys are pressed.
							// Bind left, right, up, and down animation to those keys.
						// Set player movement speed at a fixed amount.
				// Spawn new items/sprites over time
						// Set up a timer
						// Loop items drop at random positions over fixed periods of time.
							// Continue spawning new items/sprites until the player hits the wall, themselves, or they cannot continue.
				// AI:
						// Sprites move randomly.
							// Bind sprite left, right, up, and down animation to AI’s movements.
							// Sprites move at a fixed amount of speed.
							// Sprites cannot move out of the boundary of walls.
				// Elongate player avatar.
						//If the player attains an item/sprite, the player elongates by 1 block.
							// The item/sprite disappears after colliding with the player.
				// Test score/loss condition. 
						// Collision detections overall:
							// Set up collision detection between the player and the sprite.
							// Set up collision detection between walls and the player.
							// Set up collision detection when the player collides with themselves.
						// Score: The player hits an item/sprite and gains 1 point.
						// Lose: The player hits a wall or themselves.
