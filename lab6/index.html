				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of the lab was to use arrays and objects in JavaScript.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I had a lot of difficulty in this lab with getting my socure output to show my javascript. I tried talking to my partner, asking for help in the discord, etc but
					I only figured it out through someone remidning me to try WesBot. The bot winded up helping me find my issue quickly, it was a small JavaScript coding issue all along.
