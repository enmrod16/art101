					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to "experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks."</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was struggling a bit with getting my console to show my functions and such for the assignment.
						After some brief editing and observation of the examples and my partners work, I realized I was just missing my named var tags and more console.log's.
